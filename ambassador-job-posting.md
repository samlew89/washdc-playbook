We're looking for a hustler to help grow the Helium Network in DC. Your job: get local businesses to host Helium Hotspots — small wireless devices that provide coverage and earn crypto rewards for the host.

This is a field-based, commission-heavy role. You'll be walking into coffee shops, coworking spaces, breweries, and gyms to pitch a simple value prop: better service for their customers, passive income, and helping build out Washington D.C. connectivity.

**Ideal for:** Students, recent grads, or anyone with hustle who wants flexible hours and uncapped earning potential.
