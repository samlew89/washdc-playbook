## Description

We're looking for a results-driven operator and connector to help us grow the Helium Network in the Washington, DC area and maximize our impact. Your core responsibility will be driving Helium Hotspot deployments by approaching and educating local businesses, property owners, and other commercial partners (deployments create wireless coverage to benefit undercovered areas). This is a high-impact, field-based role best suited for someone with strong skills around concise communication, adapting to new technology, and building a pipeline. If you're excited about the intersection of social impact, wireless, and crypto, read on!

You will be the go-to contact for local deployment efforts — identifying high-potential hosts, guiding prospects through onboarding, and converting host interest into live Helium infrastructure. This is a short term contract position with the potential to grow into something more.

**Ideal for:** Students, recent grads, or anyone with hustle who wants flexible hours and uncapped earning potential.
