# DC Ambassador Program — Commission-Based Install Sourcing

## Program Overview

**Mission:** Recruit local ambassadors to source qualified venue installations in Dupont Circle and 14th St/U St corridors, paying commission only for verified, high-quality deployments.

**Key Principles:**
1. Pay for RESULTS, not leads
2. Reward DENSITY, not sprawl
3. Verify EVERYTHING before payment
4. Clawback for fraud or failure

# Part 1: Commission Structure Options

## Option A: Simple Flat Rate

**Best for:** Pilot program, simple tracking, predictable costs

| Install Type | Commission |
|--------------|------------|
| Indoor hotspot installed + verified | $50 |
| Outdoor hotspot installed + verified | $75 |
| Combo (indoor + outdoor same venue) | $100 |

**Pros:** Easy to understand, easy to track
**Cons:** No incentive for density or high-value venues

---

## Option B: Tiered Performance

**Best for:** Motivating high performers, scaling effort

| Monthly Installs | Indoor Rate | Outdoor Rate | Combo Rate |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 1-5 installs | $40 | $60 | $80 |
| 6-15 installs | $50 | $75 | $100 |
| 16-30 installs | $60 | $90 | $120 |
| 31+ installs | $75 | $100 | $150 |

**Tier resets monthly.** Ambassadors climb tiers as they close more installs.

**Pros:** Rewards consistent performers, encourages volume
**Cons:** May incentivize quantity over quality

## Option C: Density Bonus (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Achieving hyper-density goals in target zones

### Base Commission

| **Cluster Bonus** (3+ installs within 300ft) | +$25 per install | Extra $75 for 3-unit cluster |
| **Speed Bonus** (install within 48hrs of lead) | +$15 | |
