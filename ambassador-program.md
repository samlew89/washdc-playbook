## Description

The Helium Foundation is looking for a results-driven operator and connector to help us grow the Helium Network in the Washington D.C. area and maximize our impact. Your core responsibility will be driving Helium Hotspot deployments by approaching and educating local businesses, property owners, and other commercial partners (deployments create wireless coverage to benefit undercovered areas). This is a high-impact, field-based role best suited for someone with strong skills around concise communication, adapting to new technology, and building a pipeline. If you're excited about the intersection of social impact, wireless, and crypto, read on!

You will be the go-to contact for local deployment efforts - identifying high-potential hosts, guiding prospects through onboarding, and converting host interest into live Helium infrastructure. This is a short term contract position with the potential to grow into something more.

## Requirements

**Drive Helium Hotspot Deployments**

- Work with the team to target various neighborhoods and build a pipeline of hosts and site partners. You'll educate local small businesses, property owners, and other commercial partners to deploy new Helium Hotspot installations.
- Own the full funnel — from outreach and education to onboarding and deployment follow-through.
- Work closely with builders and technical operators to ensure quality installations.
- Leverage existing channels (e.g., chambers of commerce, real estate networks, MSPs) to source scalable opportunities.

**Educate The Community**

- Evangelize Helium and the social impact of decentralized wireless across local events and community organizations.
- Educate non-technical stakeholders in business associations, chambers of commerce, and municipalities on the benefits of providing coverage.
- Create ongoing feedback loops with local partners and report blockers, trends, or suggestions to the Helium Foundation.

## Who You Are

- 1+ years of professional experience in partnerships, business development, sales, or field marketing — or equivalent hustle and drive.
- Motivated by outcomes and a history of exceeding expectations.
- A clear communicator. A strong local network and street-level knowledge of D.C. neighborhoods is critical.
- Experience working with small businesses or local organizations is a plus.
- Crypto-native or curious — you don't need to be technical, but a passion for innovative technology is essential.

## Benefits

You'll be at the frontlines of the Helium Network's most exciting growth market — working on novel wireless infrastructure, shaping the next wave of connectivity, and helping build the future of how we connect. If this sounds like you, we want to hear from you!
