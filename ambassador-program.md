# Part 2: Job Description

## The Opportunity

We're looking for a hustler to help grow the Helium Network in DC. Your job: get local businesses to host Helium Hotspots — small wireless devices that provide coverage and earn crypto rewards for the host.

This is a field-based, commission-heavy role. You'll be walking into coffee shops, coworking spaces, breweries, and gyms to pitch a simple value prop: free hardware, passive income, zero effort for them. The more installs you close, the more you earn.

**Ideal for:** Students, recent grads, or anyone with hustle who wants flexible hours and uncapped earning potential.

---

## What You'll Do

- **Source hosts:** Identify and approach businesses in target neighborhoods (Dupont Circle, 14th St, U St)
- **Pitch & educate:** Explain the Helium Network and why hosting a hotspot is a no-brainer for local businesses
- **Close installs:** Guide prospects from first conversation to signed agreement to live deployment
- **Hit your targets:** Stay active and meet monthly install goals

---

## Who You Are

- Based in DC with knowledge of Dupont Circle and/or 14th St/U St areas
- Comfortable walking into businesses and starting conversations
- Motivated by results — you like seeing direct payoff for your effort
- Reliable and organized — you can manage a pipeline and follow through
- Curious about crypto, wireless tech, or decentralized networks (no technical background required)

**No experience required** — just hustle and communication skills. Sales, marketing, or hospitality background is a plus but not necessary.

## How to Apply

Send a short email to [EMAIL] with:
1. Your name and phone number
2. Why you're interested (2-3 sentences is fine)
3. Your availability (hours/week you can commit)

No resume required. We'll set up a quick call to see if it's a fit.
