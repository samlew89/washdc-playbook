# Deployer Bootcamp

## Summary

Helium is hosting a Deployer Bootcamp in Washington, DC to build on prior sessions while evolving the format toward a clearer outcome: **creating net-new deployers**. The DC bootcamp is designed to not only educate the audience, but actually bring them out into the field. Our goal is to convert motivated attendees into operators who can repeatedly identify venues, close hosts, and complete high-quality deployments.

---

## Audience

Base audience matches the playbook (new individual deployers, regional operators/installers, community leaders, etc.).

### DC Targeting Focus (High-Intent Profiles)

- Entrepreneur / hustler types with fast access to locations (operators, friends-of-operators, neighborhood connectors)
- TaskRabbit-style service providers (handyman / low-voltage / AV installers)
- Web3/crypto community in DC (e.g., Solana meetups) that will actually take action

### Conversion Targets

- Create 10–20 net-new high-intent deployers in the DC area

---

## Program Design Overview

We keep the core bootcamp components, but re-balance time to prioritize field outcomes.

| Component | DC Interpretation | Key Output |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Classroom | Condensed, high-signal classroom focused on host closing + install readiness | Why Helium + Pitch kit + routing plan |
| Field Deployments | Top community deployers lead teams in the field and validate outcomes | Mentor-verified installs/closes |
| Community | Networking + follow-up channel | Lasting peer network |
| Recognition | Giveaways + simple credentialing to create momentum | Retention + repeat deploys |

## Bootcamp Schedule

### Classroom Portion

**Theme:** Understand & Prepare (compressed)
**Goal:** Build skills, form teams, and lock a field plan.

| Session | Description | Owner | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Check-in + networking | Guests network with the team and each other | Helium Rep | Attendees onboarded |
| Why Helium / why deploy (short) | Motivation + economics + success stories | Helium Rep | Motivated participants |
| Kickoff & DC objectives | What "success" means: new deployers + closes/installs | Helium Rep | Shared alignment |
| DC opportunity map | Target neighborhoods + "good host" criteria | Helium Rep | Target areas selected |
| Finding & engaging hosts | Role-play scripts, objections, close flow | Community Deployer | Outreach toolkit |
| The deal + consent | What we capture, how we schedule installs | Community Deployer | Host consent workflow |
| Install readiness + QA | Live install demos in the classroom + Q&A | Community Deployer | Hands on field readiness |
| Team briefing | Preparation for field day | Helium Rep | Plan locked |

### Field Portion

**Best for:** Maximum immediacy; people leave and do outreach while momentum is high
**Tradeoff:** Long day; some venues harder to access late

| Time | Activity | Output Definition |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 5:30pm - 7:30pm | Meet outside venue + gear check | Teams ready |
| 7:30pm - 9:30pm | Field outreach + closes | "Success" = host close + scheduled install (installs only when feasible) |

## Field Strategy Options

Within any option above, we choose one of these field-mode approaches (or a hybrid):

### 1) Warm Lead Demonstration (Pre-Arranged Venues)

**What it is:** Secure 1–3 venues in advance and use them as "live reps" for close + install + QA

**Minimum requirements:**
- 1–3 committed venues with clear install windows
- Pre-checked power/mounting feasibility
- "Demo team" mentor(s) + equipment ready

### 2) Real Live Venue Hunting

**What it is:** Teams go into target neighborhoods with scripts + collateral and attempt closes

**Minimum requirements:**
- Target list / map (specific neighborhoods and/or venues)
- Tight scripts + objection handling
- Clear "close criteria" and follow-up scheduling flow

---

## Target Audience & Lead Generation

**Primary goal:** 10–20 net-new deployers (quality > quantity)

### Attendee Acquisition Channels

- Web3/crypto community outreach in DC (e.g., Solana meetups)
- TaskRabbit-style service providers / installer communities
- Chamber of Commerce + BD cold outreach

### Venue Pipeline Channels (for warm leads and/or hunting lists)

- SafeGraph mining for crypto-accepting businesses (DC map)
- Facebook ads + Typeform "hotspot claim" funnel (run 3–4 weeks pre-event)
- Direct outreach to neighborhood businesses we want to target
