# Summary & Goals

Washington DC is a focused pilot to prove that Helium can produce overlapping, carrier-grade coverage in a dense metro using Helium Carrier and Helium infrastructure, resulting in measurable carrier cost reduction through increased offload. We will concentrate deployments into two high-density commercial corridors to maximize overlap, consistency, and utilization, and use the results to validate a repeatable scaling model for other large cities.

## Network BU Plan

**1) Select and concentrate in two hyper-dense corridors**
- Lock the two neighborhoods (Dupont Circle and the 14th St NW + U St NW corridor)
- Define clear sub-zones ("pods") and install targets per pod to create overlap quickly

**2) Build a prioritized venue pipeline, not a generic lead list**
- Generate venue targets with addresses, category, install feasibility, and outdoor potential
- Rank venues by a repeatable priority score optimized for overlap and utilization, not just volume

**3) Activate a hardcore deployer base and remove friction to installs**
- Run a deployer bootcamp designed to produce immediate installs, including classroom onboarding and structured time in the field to secure hosts and install hotspots
- Reduce friction by providing free indoor and outdoor hotspots, plus targeted promotions, to accelerate deployments in the two focus corridors

**4) Drive installs through two parallel sourcing channels**
- Ambassadors paid on qualified installations sourced (commission model)
- QR-based pamphlets to generate inbound qualified leads that deployers can close

## KPIs

- Helium Mobile % offloaded onto Helium Hotspots
- Number of active deployers in DC
- Qualified hotspots installed (Indoor)
- Qualified hotspots installed (Outdoor)
