## Scoring Methodology

Venues are scored 0-100 using five weighted categories. See [Venue Scoring Rubric](venue-scoring-rubric.md) for full details.

| Category | Weight | Confidence | Data Source |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Outdoor Mounting Viability | 35% | High | Category inference (rooftop bars, patios) |
| Location & Line-of-Sight | 25% | Low | Neutral baseline (can't detect corners from API) |
| Foot Traffic & Dwell Time | 15% | Medium | Review count + category (coffee = high dwell) |
| Permissioning Speed | 15% | Low | Chain detection + category (independent = better) |
| Operational Reliability | 10% | Medium | Category proxy (coffee shops = long hours) |

**Score Tiers:**
- **75+: HOT** - Priority outreach, likely fast close
- **55-74: WARM** - Good candidates, standard pipeline
- **40-54: COOL** - Lower priority, pursue if capacity allows
- **<40: SKIP** - Deprioritize unless situation changes

*Note: Scores are conservative because Location (25%) uses neutral baseline — corner lot detection requires manual verification.*
