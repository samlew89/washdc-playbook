# Hyper-Density Venue Scoring Rubric (0-100)

## Design Principles

This rubric is optimized for **outdoor coverage density**, not just indoor installs. We prioritize venues that:
1. Allow outdoor mounts on the same building
2. Can be closed and installed FAST (simple permissioning)
3. Sit at high-value locations (corners, intersections, sight lines)
4. Have reliable power/backhaul and accessible hours

| **Location & Line-of-Sight** | 20 | 20% | Coverage reach per unit |
| **Foot Traffic & Dwell Time** | 15 | 15% | Network utilization value |
| **Operational Reliability** | 10 | 10% | Long-term uptime |

## Auto-Reject Rules

**Immediately disqualify a venue if ANY of the following are true:**

| Rule # | Auto-Reject Condition | Why |
|--------|----------------------|-----|
| AR-1 | No decision-maker identifiable after 2 contact attempts | Will never close |
| AR-2 | Corporate/franchise HQ approval required (national chain) | 4+ week cycle minimum |
| AR-3 | Landlord explicitly declined exterior modifications | Dead end |
| AR-4 | No power within 50ft of viable mount point | Install cost prohibitive |
| AR-5 | Basement-only or below-grade location | Zero coverage value |
| AR-6 | Venue closing/relocating within 6 months | Wasted hardware |
| AR-7 | Owner hostile or explicitly anti-tech | Will not close |
| AR-8 | Located in zone already at density target (3+ outdoor units within 400ft) | Diminishing returns |

**If auto-reject triggered:** Mark lead as "Rejected - [Rule #]" and do not pursue further.

## High-Priority Archetypes

These venue profiles consistently score 75+ and should be prioritized in prospecting:

### Tier S: Anchor Nodes (Target: 85-100 points)

| Archetype | Why | Expected Score |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Coffee shop on a corner with patio** | High traffic, long dwell, corner sightline, owner-operated, outdoor seating = outdoor mount | 88-95 |
| **Brewery/taproom with rooftop or patio** | Evening crowds, rooftop access, owner-operated, high dwell | 85-92 |
| **Co-working space in multi-story building** | All-day traffic, rooftop access likely, tech-forward owner | 82-90 |
| **Gym/fitness studio on corner lot** | Morning + evening peaks, owner decides, often has exterior signage = mount viable | 80-88 |

### Tier A: High-Value Targets (Target: 70-84 points)

| Archetype | Why | Expected Score |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Fast-casual restaurant with sidewalk seating** | Lunch/dinner traffic, awning mount, patio presence | 72-82 |
| **Wine bar / cocktail bar with outdoor area** | Evening density, often owner-operated, patio | 70-80 |
| **Barber shop / salon on main drag** | Neighborhood anchor, owner on-site daily, simple approval | 68-78 |
| **Boutique retail on corner** | Corner lot advantage, owner-operated, street visibility | 65-75 |

### Tier B: Solid Pipeline (Target: 55-69 points)

| Archetype | Why | Expected Score |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Laundromat** | High dwell, but often mid-block, limited outdoor | 58-68 |
| **Phone repair / tech shop** | Tech-friendly owner, but small footprint | 55-65 |
| **Nail salon on main corridor** | Dwell time, but often no outdoor option | 52-62 |

### Avoid / Deprioritize

| Archetype | Why | Expected Score |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **National chain fast food** | Corporate approval = 4+ weeks, no outdoor control | 25-40 |
| **Bank branch** | Corporate HQ, no outdoor mount rights | 20-35 |
| **Large restaurant (full-service, not owner-operated)** | Manager-only on-site, complex approval | 30-45 |
| **Medical office / clinic** | Compliance concerns, limited hours | 25-40 |

## Score Calculator (Quick Math)

For field use, use this simplified scoring:

| Category | Quick Question | Fast Score |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Outdoor Mount | Can I see where we'd mount outside? | Yes = 25, Maybe = 15, No = 5 |
| Permissioning | Is owner here and in charge? | Yes = 20, Manager = 12, Corporate = 5 |
| Location | Corner lot with clear sightline? | Corner = 18, Near corner = 12, Mid-block = 6 |
| Traffic | Busy with people staying a while? | High+dwell = 13, Medium = 8, Low = 4 |
| Reliability | Power + WiFi + good hours? | All 3 = 10, 2 of 3 = 6, 1 or less = 3 |

**Quick total = Outdoor + Permission + Location + Traffic + Reliability**

| Quick Total | Verdict |
|-------------|---------|
| 75+ | HOT — pitch now |
| 55-74 | WARM — leave pamphlet, follow up |
| 40-54 | COOL — add to list, low priority |
| <40 | SKIP |
